# AocVisualized

Visualize some Advent of Code solutions with Phoenix LiveView.

I mostly take solutions from [sevenseacat's repo](https://github.com/sevenseacat/advent_of_code) and adapt them to render some visualisation in a LiveView.

Days I have visualised are accessible via the normal AoC routing: `/$year/day$dayNumber`, e.g. `http://localhost:4000/2015/day3`.

To start your Phoenix server:

  * Run `mix setup` to install and setup dependencies
  * Start Phoenix endpoint with `mix phx.server` or inside IEx with `iex -S mix phx.server`

Now you can visit [`localhost:4000`](http://localhost:4000) from your browser.
